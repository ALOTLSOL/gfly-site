        <dt>Q: How do I request a taxi?</dt>
        <dd>A: Simply download our app, then tap a button to begin. If the air taxi is near and available - it will land near you.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How much does it cost?</dt>
        <dd>A: Since Gib Fly is a marketplace for flight-based transportation, the price you pay is based on factors such 
          as distance and availability of taxis. You set the maximum price you’re willing to pay for a given flight.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How does it work?</dt>
        <dd>A: Our product is powered by a complex algorithm which efficiently matches idle taxis 
          with passengers based on factors such as proximity and shortest time-to-destination. 
          The system is built on a serverless architecture, which makes running and scaling our 
          backend services simple and cost-effective, allowing us to reliably serve the needs of Gib Fly’ ever growing user base.</dd>
        <dt>Q: What if I have a complaint about my flight?</dt>
        <dd>A: Gib Fly is a customer obsessed company. We value each 
          customer and want to ensure a positive experience. 
          Therefore, we’ve staffed our customer service team with serverless chatbots that are available 24/7 to assist you.</dd>

        <dt>Q: How many passengers can my taxi take?</dt>
        <dd>A: The number of passengers on a single Flight depends on the size of your taxi. Most taxis can take one passenger per Flight. You can also request a large size taxi which can take up to two passengers. If you select Sleigh version, you can take up to 4 passengers.</dd>
        <dt>Q: What if I lose an item during my Flight?</dt>
        <dd>A: Unfortunately, it’s unlikely we can retrieve your lost item if it has fallen off the taxi during your Flight.</dd>

        <dt>Q: What if my taxi doesn’t match the photo in the app?</dt>
        <dd>A: The taxi photo in your app should match the taxi that arrives to pick you up. If they do not match, then Gib Fly recommends that you do not board the taxi. You should then immediately report the imposter taxi to Gib Fly.</dd>

        <dt>Q: Why do you charge a service fee?</dt>
        <dd>A: The service fee is a fixed charge added to every Flight. This helps us pay for our on-going maintenance and operating costs required to run the service and tend to our taxi herd.</dd>
